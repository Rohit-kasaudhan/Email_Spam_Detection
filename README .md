A machine learning web app that classifies emails and SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Legitimate)** using Multinomial Naive Bayes and TF-IDF vectorization — with a clean Streamlit GUI.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning** — Drops unused columns, removes duplicates, renames labels
2. **EDA** — Pie chart, bar charts, distribution plots, pairplot, and word clouds
3. **Text Preprocessing** — HTML removal → special character removal → lowercase → stopword removal → stemming
4. **Balancing** — Undersampling to equalize ham/spam class counts
5. **Vectorization** — TF-IDF with 1500 features and bigrams `(1,2)`
6. **Model** — Multinomial Naive Bayes (`alpha=0.5`)
7. **Evaluation** — Accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix heatmap

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/email-spam-detection.git
cd email-spam-detection
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the model

Open and run all cells in `Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb`. This generates `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`.

```bash
jupyter notebook Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- **Size:** 5,572 messages (4,825 ham + 747 spam)
- **Columns used:** `v1` (label) and `v2` (message text)
- **After balancing:** 653 ham + 653 spam (undersampling)
